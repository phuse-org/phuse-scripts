### CDISC Pilot Data

PhUSE CS Working Group 5 use CDISC esubmission pilot data to develop code.

CDISC originally published these data in a pilot electronic submission package:
  * http://www.cdisc.org/sdtmadam-pilot-project
  * Complete CDISC pilot package is available to CDISC members
  * Location of these ADaM data within that CDISC archive:<br/>updated Pilot Submission Package\900172\m5\datasets\cdiscpilot01\analysis\adam\datasets\

**[See also the cdisc-split folder](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/tree/master/data/adam/cdisc-split),** a variation of these CDISC data, with multiple studies rather than one single study.
